MarkUTApp is an Android mobile application which allows UT community members to connect with each other in an online marketplace of products and services. MarkUTApp facilitates the contacts between buyers and sellers with an official UT email address, and encourages easy and convenient on-campus transactions. Any user can buy or sell depending on the listings they post and the listings they respond to. This application provides a more communal alternative to eBay of specific interest to the UT community. 

Account Login - On startup, users with existing accounts are prompted to login with their existing credentials. Successful login results in being redirected to Dashboard. New users are prompted to create a new account which will redirect them to Account Registration. There is a link that allows users to reset their password. 

Account Registration - Users are taken through the process of creating a new account, filling out their account information, including name, username, email, password, and phone number. Sensitive information is protected via encryption as it is passed to the server. Specific users are granted administrator accounts and have the ability to deactivate advertisements. 

Dashboard - Upon logging into their account, users are directed to the dashboard interface. This interface includes a search bar and categories for various products/services. Using these, users can look for a product/service that they are wanting. The dashboard interface also includes a button to post an advertisement for a product/service.  

Listing Information – Selecting an item brings up a detailed view of that item. This view contains a more elaborate description of the item, including images, text, and conditions, as well as information about the poster. Sellers provide their contact information to communicate independently with the buyer. Users also independently handle the transfer of money. On each listing, there is a report button, which notifies an administrator to review the listing. Sellers will be able to see a list of advertisements they have posted. 

Post or Modify Advertisement – Users are able to create their own listing with parameters like title, price, category, condition, description, availability, and the option to add pictures. Posts are saved to the database. The information contained in the advertisement can be edited, and users have the option to activate or deactivate their posts. When a post is deactivated, the statistics of the transactions are saved.
